Welcome, curious traveler. You’ve drawn the Ace of Code.

<br>



## 🪄 Act I: The Opening Spell

You’ve stumbled upon the personal sanctum of a **Swift-wielding spellcrafter**. 🧝🏽‍♀️ <br>
Trained as a Computer Science Wizard in the arcane halls of the **Tecnológico de Monterrey**. 🎓 <br>
Currently refining their magic at the _**Apple Developer Academy**_. 🍎

☀️  By day, I craft elegant solutions with lines of code. <br>
🌙  By night, I perfect the art of digital illusion — intuitive interfaces, seamless experiences, and modular magic.

📜 Within these scrolls lies a chronicle of enchantments, curiosities, and code.

<br>



## 🔮 Act II: The Arcane Toolbox

I conjure with:

- 🪄 `Swift`, `Python`, `C++`, `SQL`, `CSS`, `HTML` (Potions)
- ✨ `SwiftUI` (Illusions of interactivity)
- 🗃️ `SwiftData`, `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `MongoDB` (Memory manipulation)
- 🛠️ `Figma`, `Xcode`, `VS Code` (Crafting Tools)

Areas of Enchantment:

- 🧩 iOS & Mobile Spellcraft  
- 🎨 UI/UX Runes & Glyphs  
- 🧠 Algorithms Rituals  
- 🛡️ Cyber-wards and Data Analysis

<br>

> “I currently study the ways of elegant conjuring in iOS mobile apps — where code is graceful, design is delightful, and function feels like sorcery.” 🧙🏽‍♀️

<br>



## 🧵 Act III: Thread of Fate

🌌 I’m building something memorable — code that surprises, delights, and endures.  
🎪 Peek behind the curtain, if you dare...
